### Overview
* [Git-Clash](http://git-clash.herokuapp.com/) is meant to be used as a simplified method to decide on the best candidates to hire based on their past github history.
* Face off against different github users head to head. Victory is based on a score that is calculated from followers, commits, and number of public repos.
* Users can also search individual Github profiles as well as view previous battle leaderboards.
